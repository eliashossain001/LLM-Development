history in briefusa george washington addressing the constitutional convention in philadelphia 1787 introduction the history of the united states has been an experiment in democracy for more than 200 years issues that were addressed in the early years continue to be addressed and resolved today big government versus small government individual rights versus group rights unfettered capitalism versus regulated commerce and labor engagement with the world versus isolationism the expectations for american democracy have always been high and the reality has sometimes been disappointing yet the nation has grown and prospered through a continual process of adaptation and compromise 1 early america at the height of the most recent ice age about 35000 years ago much of the worlds water was locked up in vast continental ice sheets a land bridge as much as 1500 kilometers wide connected asia and north america by 12000 years ago humans were living throughout much of the western hemisphere the fi rst americans crossed the land bridge from asia and were believed to have stayed in what is now alaska for 2 thousands of years they then moved south into the land that was to become the united states they settled along the pacifi c ocean in the northwest in the mountains and deserts of the southwest and along the mississip pi river in the middle west these early groups are known as hohokam adenans hopewellians and anasazi they built villages and grew crops some built mounds of earth in the shapes of pyramids birds or serpents their life was closely ti ed to the land and their society was clanoriented and communal elements of the natural world played an essential part in their spiritual beliefs their left mesa verde settlement in colorado 13th century above aerial view of the great serpent mound in adams county ohio carbon tests of the effi gy revealed that the creators of this 1330foot monument were members of the nativeamerican fort ancient culture ad 10001550 3 4culture was primarily oral althou gh some developed a type of hieroglyphics to preserve certain texts evidence shows that there was a good deal of trade among the groups but also that some of their relations were hostile for reasons not yet completely understood these early groups disappeared over time and were replaced by other groups of native americans including hopi and zuni who fl ourished by the time europeans reached what is now the united states about two million native people maybe more lived here the fi rst europeans to arrive in north america at least the fi rst for whom there is soli d evidence were norse they traveled west from greenland where erik the red had founded a settlement around the ye ar 985 in 1001 his son leif is thought to have explored the northeast coast of what is now canada ruins of norse houses dating from that time have been discovered at lanseauxmeadows in northern newfoundland it would be almost 500 more years before other europeans reached north america and another 100 years after that before permanent settlements were established the fi rst explorers were searching for a sea pass age to asia others chiefl y british dutch french and spanish came later to claim the lands and riches of what they called the new world the fi rst and most famous of these explorers was christopher columbus of genoa his trips were fi nanced by queen isabella of spain columbus landed on islands in the caribbean sea in 1492 but he never saw the mainland of the future united states john cabot of venice came fi ve years later on a mission for the king of england his journey was quickly forgotten but it provided the basis for british claims to north america the 1500s were the age of spanish exploration in the americas juan ponce de len landed in what is now florida in 1513 hernando de soto reached florida in 1539 and continued as far as the mississippi river in 1540 francisco vzquez de coronado set out north from mexico which spain had two monuments to the central role spain played in the exploration of what is now the united states left the castillo de san marcos built 16721695 to guard st augustine florida the fi rst permanent european settlement

junpero serra in the 1770s serra led the spanish colonization of what is today the state of california 5 6conquered in 1522 in search of the mythical seven cities of cibola he never found them but his travels took him as far as the grand canyon in arizona as well as into the great plains while the spanish were pushin g up from the south the northern portion of the presentday united states was slowly being revealed through the jour neys of other europeans these included giovanni da verrazano jacques cartier and amerigo vespucci for whom the continent america would be named the fi rst permanent european settlement in what was to become the united states was established by the spanish in the middle 1500s at st augustine in florida however it would not play a part in the formation of the new nation that story took place in settlements farthe r north along the atlantic coast in virginia massachusetts new york and the 10 other areas colonized by a growing tide of immigrants from europe colonial period most settlers who came to the british colonies in the 1600s were english others came from the netherlands sweden germany france and later from scotland and northern ireland some left their homelands to escape war political oppression religious persecution or a prison sentence some left as servants who expected to work their way to freedom black africans were sold into slavery and arrived in shackles 7by 1690 the population was 250000 less than 100 years later it had climbed to 25 million the settlers had many diff erent reasons for coming to america and eventually 13 dist inct colonies developed here diff erences among the three regional groupings of colonies were even more marked the fi rst settlements were built along the atlantic coast and on the rivers that fl owed to the ocean in the northeast settlers found hills covered with trees and soil fi lled with stones left behind when the ice age glaciers melted water power was easy to harness so new england including massachusetts connecticut and rhode island developed an economy based on wood products fi shing shipbuilding and trade the middle colonies including new york and pennsylvania had a milder climate and more varied terrain both industry and agriculture developed there and society was more varied and cosmopolitan in new york for example one could fi nd bohemians danes dutch english french germans irish italians norwegians poles portuguese scots and swedes the southern colonies virginia georgia and the carolinas had a long growing season an d fertile soil and the economy was primarily

and signer of both the declaration of independence and the constitution 10relations between settlers and native americans who were called indians were an unea sy mix of cooperation and confl ict certain areas saw trade and some social interaction but in general as the new settlement s expanded the indians were forced to move often after being defeated in battle settlement of the colonies was directly sponsored not by the british government but by private groups all except georgia emerged as companies of shareholders or as proprietorships chartered by the king some were governed rigidly by company leaders but in time all develo ped a system of participatory government based on british legal precedent and tradition years of political turmoil in britain culminated with the glorious revolution of 168889 that deposed king james ii and led to limits on the monarchy and greater freedoms for the people the american colonies benefi ted from these changes colonial assemblies cl aimed the right to act as local parliaments they passed measures that limited the power of royal governors and expanded their own power over the decades that followed recurring disputes between the governors and assemblies awakened colonists to the increasing divergence between american and british interests the principles and precedents that emerged from these disputes became the unwritten constitution of the colonies at fi rst the focus was on selfgovernment within a british commonwealth only later came the call for independence 11road to independence the principles of liberalism and democracy the political foundation of the united states sprang naturally from the process of building a new society on virgin land just as naturally the new nation would see itself as diff erent and exceptional europe would view it with apprehension or hope britains 13 north american colonies matured during the 1700s they grew in population economic strength and cultural attainment they were experienced in selfgovernment yet it was not until 170 years after the founding of the fi rst permanent settlement at jamestown virginia that the new united states of america emerged as a nation war between britain and france in the 1750s was fought partly in north america britain was victorious and soon initiated policies designed to control and fund its vast empire these measures imposed greater restraints on the american colonists way of life the royal proclamation of 1763 restricted the opening of new lands for settlement the sugar act of 1764 placed taxes on luxury goods including coff ee silk and wine and made it illegal to import rum the currency act of 1764 prohibited the printing of paper money in the colonies the quartering act of 1765 forced colonists to provide food and housing for royal troops and the stamp act of 1765 required the purchase of royal 12stamps for all legal documents newspapers licenses and leases colonists objected to all these measures but the stamp act sparked the greatest organized resistance the main issue in the eyes of a growing number of colonists was that they were being taxed by a distant legislature in which they could not participate in october 1765 27 delegates from nine colonies met in new york to coordinate eff orts to get the stamp act repealed they passed resoluti ons asserting the individual colonies right to impose their own taxes selfgovernment produced local political leaders and these were the men who worked to gether to defeat what they considered to be oppressive acts of parliament after they succeeded their coordinated campaign against britain ended during the next several years however a small number of radicals tried to keep the controversy alive their goal was not accommodation but independence samuel adams of massachusetts was the most eff ective he wrote newspaper articles and made speeches appealing to the colonists democratic instincts he helped organize committees throughout the colonies that became the basis of a revolutionary movement by 1773 the movement had attracted colonial traders who were angry with british attempts to regulate the tea trade in december a group of men sneaked on to three british ships in boston harbor and dumped their cargo of tea overboard 13to punish massachusetts for the vandalism the british parliament closed the port of boston and restricted local authority the new measures dubbed the intolerable acts backfi red rather than isolate one colony they rallied the others all the colonies except georgia sent representatives to philadelphia in september 1774 to discuss their present unhappy state it was the fi rst continental congress colonists felt a growing sens e of frustration and anger over british encroachment on their rights yet by no means was there unanimity of thought on what should be done loyalists wanted to remain subjects of the king moderates favored compromise to produce a more acceptable relationship with the british government and revolutionaries wanted complete independence they began stockpiling weapons and mobilizing forces waiting for the day when they would have to fi ght for it revolution the american revolution its war for independence from britain began as a small skirmish between british troops and armed colonists on april 19 1775 the british had set out from boston massachusetts to seize weapons and ammunition that revolutionary colonists had collected in nearby villages at lexington they met a group of minutemen who got that name because they were said to 14the protest against british taxes known as the boston tea party 1773 16artists depiction of the fi rst shots of the american revolution fi red at lexington massachusetts on april 19 1775 local militia confronted british troops marching to seize

debate over ratifi cation of the constitution were collected with those of alexander hamilton and john jay as the federalist papers 19be ready to fi ght in a minute the minutemen intended only a silent protest and their leader told them not to shoot unless fi red on fi rst the british ordered the minutemen to disperse and they complied as they were withdrawing someone fi red a shot the british troops attacked the minutemen with guns and bayonets fighting broke out at other places along the road as the british soldiers in their bright red uniforms made their way back to boston more than 250 redcoats were killed or wounded the americans lost 93 men deadly clashes continued around boston as colonial representatives hurried to philadelphia to discuss the situation a majority voted to go to war against britain they agreed to alexander hamilton secretary of the treasury in the administration of president george washington hamilton advocated a strong federal government and the encouragement of industry john marshall chief justice of the us supreme court from 1801 to 1835 in a portrait by alonzo chappel 20combine colonial militias into a continental army and they appointed george washington of virginia as commanderinchief at the same time however this second continental congress adopted a peace resolution urging king george iii to prevent further hostilities the king rejected it and on august 23 declared that the american colonies were in rebellion calls for independence intensifi ed in the coming months radical political theorist thomas paine helped crystallize the argument for separation in a pamphlet called common sense which sold 100000 copies he attacked the idea of a hereditary monarchy paine presented two alternatives for america continued submission under a tyrannical king and outworn system of government or liberty and happiness as a selfsuffi cient independent republic the second continental congress appointed a committee headed by thomas jeff erson of virginia to prepare a document outlining the colonies grievances against the king and explaining their decision to break away this declaration of independence was adopted on july 4 1776 the 4th of july has since been celebrated as americas independence day the declaration of independence not only announced the birth of a new nation it also set forth a philosophy of human freedom that would become a dynamic force throughout the world it drew upon french and br itish political ideas especially those of john locke in his second treatise on government 21reaffi rming the belief that political rights are basic human rights and are thus universal declaring independence did not make americans free british forces routed continental troops in new york from long island to new york city they defeated the americans at brandywine pennsylvania and occupied philadelphia forcing the continental congress to fl ee american forces were victorious at saratoga new york and at trenton and princeton in new jersey yet george washington continually struggled to get the men and materials he desperately needed decisive help came in 1778 when france recognized the united states and signed a bilateral defense treaty support from the french government however was based on geopolitical not ideological reasons france wanted to weaken the power of britain its longtime adversary the fi ghting that began at lexington massachusetts continued for eight years across a large portion of the continent battles were fought from montreal canada in the north to savannah georgia in the south a huge british army surrendered at yorktown virginia in 1781 yet the war dragged on with inconclusive results for another two years a peace treaty was fi nally signed in paris on april 15 1783 the revolution had a signifi cance far beyond north america it attracted the attentio n of europes political theorists and strengthened the concept of natural rights throughout 22the western world it attracte d notables such as thaddeus kosciusko friedrich von steuben and the marquis de lafayette who joined the revolution and hope d to transfer its liberal ideas to their own countries the treaty of paris acknowledged the independence freedom and sovereignty of the 13 former american colonies now states the task of knitting them together into a new nation lay ahead formation of a national government the 13 american colonies became the 13 united states of america in 1783 following their war for independence from britain before the war ended they ratifi ed a framework for their common eff orts these articles of confederation provided for a union but an extremely loose and fragile one george washington called it a rope of sand there was no common currency individual states still produced their own there was no national military force many states still had their own armies and navies there was little centralized control over foreign policy states negotiated directly with other countries an d there was no national system for imposing and collecting taxes disputes between maryland and virginia over navigation rights on the potomac river which formed their common border led to a conference of fi ve states in annapolis maryland in 1786 alexander hamilton a delegate from new york said that such commercial issues were part of larger economic and political questions what was needed he said was a rethinking of the confederation he and the other delegates proposed holding a convention to do just that support from washington unquestionably the most truste d man in america won over those who thought the idea was too bold the gathering in philadelphia in may 1787 was remarkable the 55 delegates elected to the convention had experience the historic room in independence hall philadelphia where delegates drafted the constitution of the united states in the summer of 1787 the constitution is the supreme law of the land 23 24in colonial and state government they were knowledgeable in history law and political theory most were young but the group included the elderly benjamin franklin who was nearing the end of an extraordinary career of public service and scientifi c achievement two notable americans were not there thomas jeff erson was in paris as american ambassador to france and john adams was in london as ambassador to great britain the continental congress had authorized the convention to amend the articles of confederatio n instead the delegates threw aside the articles judging them inadequate for the needs of the new nation and devised a new form of government based on the separation of legislative executive and judicial powers the gathering had become a constitutional convention reaching consensus on some of the details of a new constitution would prove extremely diffi cult many delegates argued for a strong national government that limited states rights others argued equally pe rsuasively for a weak national government that preserved state authority some delegates feared that americans were not wise enough to govern themselves and so opposed any sort of popular elections others thought the national government should have as broad a popular base as possible representatives from small states insisted on equal representation in a national legislature those from big states thought they deserved to have more infl uence representatives from states where slavery was illegal hoped to 25 the liberty bell in philadelphia pennsylvania an enduring symbol of american freedom first rung on july 8 1776 to celebrate the

statehood for the newly settled lands to the west every question raised new divisions and each was resolved by compromise the draft constitution was not a long document yet it provided the framework for the most complex government yet devised the national government would have full power to issue currency levy taxes grant patents conduct foreign policy maintain an army establish post offi ces and wage war and it would have three equal branches a congress a president and a court system with balanced powers and checks against each others actions economic interests infl uenced the course of debate on the document but so did state sectional and ideological interests also important was the idealism of the men who wrote it they believed they had designed a government that would promote individual liberty and public virtue on september 17 1787 after four months of deliberation a majority of delegates signed the new constitution they agreed it would become the law of the land when nine of the 13 states had ratifi ed it the ratifi cation process lasted about a year opponents voiced fears that a strong central government could become 27tyrannical and oppressive proponents responded that the system of checks and balances would prevent this from happening the debate brought into existence two factions the federalists who favored a strong central government and who supported the constitution and the antifederalists who favored a loose association of states and who opposed the constitution even after the constitution was ratifi ed many americans felt it lacked an essential element they said it did not enumerate the rights of individuals when the fi rst congress met in new york city in september 1789 lawmakers agreed to add these provisions it took another two years before these 10 amendments collectively known as the bill of rights became part of the constitution the fi rst of the 10 amendments guarantees freedom of speech press and religion the right to protest assemble peacefully and demand changes the fourth protects against unreasonable searches and arrest the fi fth provides for due process of law in all criminal cases the sixth guarantees the right to a fair and speedy trial and the eighth protects against cruel and unusual punishment since the bill of rights was adopted more than 200 years ago only 17 more amendments have been added to the constitution 28early years westward expansion and regional differences george washington was sworn in as the fi rst president of the united states on april 30 1789 he had been in charge of organizing an eff ective military force during the revolution now he was in charge of building a functioning government he worked with congress to create departments of state treasury justice and war the heads of those departments would serve as presidential ad visors his cabinet a supreme court composed of one chief justice and fi ve associate justices was established together with three circuit courts and 13 district courts policies were develope d for administering the western territories and bringing them into the union as new states washington served two fouryear terms and then left offi ce setting a precedent that eventually became law the next two presidents john adams and thomas jeff erson represented two schools of thought on the role of government this divergence led to the formation of the fi rst political parties in the western world the federalists led by adams and alexander hamilton washingtons secretary of the treasury generally represented trade and manufacturing interests they feared anarchy and believed in a strong central government that could set national economic policies and maintain order they had the most 29support in the north republicans led by jeff erson generally represented agricultural interests they opposed a strong central government and believed in states rights and the selfsuffi ciency of farmers they had the most support in the south for about 20 years the young nation was able to thrive in relative peace its policy was to be friendly and impartial to all other nations however it was not immune from political developments in europe particularly in britain and france which were at war the british navy seized american ships headed to france and the french navy seized american ships headed to britain various diplomatic negotiations averted hostilities during the 1790s and early 1800s but it seemed only a matter of time before the united states would have to defend its interests war with britain came in 1812 fighting took place mostly in the northeastern states and along the east coast one british expeditionary force reached the new capital of washington in the district of columbia it set fi re to the executive mansion causing president james madison to fl ee and left the city in fl ames but the us army and navy won enough decisive battles to claim victory after two and a half years of fi ghting and with a treasury depleted by a separate war with france britain signed a peace treaty with the united states the us victory ended once and for all any british hopes of reestablishing infl uence south of the canadian border by the time the war of 1812 ended many of the serious diffi culties faced by the new american republic had disappeared national union under the constitution brought a balance between liberty and order a low national debt and a continent awaiting exploration presented the prospect of peace prosperity and social progress the most signifi cant event in foreign policy was a pronouncement by president james monroe expressing us solidarity with the newly independent nations of central and south america the monroe doctrine warned against any further attempts by europe to colonize latin america many of the new nations in turn expressed their political affi nity with the united states by basing their constitutions on the north american model the united states doubled in size with the purchase of the louisiana territory from france in 1803 and florida from spain in 1819 from 1816 to 1821 six new states were created between henry clay of kentucky although never president was one of the most infl uential american politicians of the fi rst half of the 19th century clay became indispensable for his role in preserving the union with the missouri compromise of 1820 and the compromise of 1850 both pieces of legislation resolved for a time disputes over slavery in the territories 30 311812 and 1852 the population tripled the young nations size and diversity defi ed easy generalization it also invited contradiction the united states was a country of both civilized cities built on commerce and industry and primitive frontiers where the rule of law was often ignored it was a society that loved freedom but permitted slavery the constitution held all these diff erent parts together the strains however were growing sectional con ict the united states in 1850 was a huge nation stretched between two oceans wide diff erences in geography natural resources and development were obvious from region to region new england and the middle atlantic states were the main centers of fi nance commerce and manufacturing principal products included textiles and clothing lumber and machinery maritime trade fl ourished the southern states were chiefl y agricultural producing tobacco sugar and cotton with slave labor the middle western states were ag ricultural too but their grain and meat products came from the hands of free men and women in 1819 missouri had applied for statehood northerners objected because there were 10 000 slaves there congressman henry clay of kentucky proposed a compromise missouri would enter the union and continue to permit slavery while 32maine would enter as a free state regional positions on the issue hardened in the decades following the missouri comp romise in the north the movement to abolish slavery was vocal and grew increasingly powerful in the south the belief in white supremacy and in maintaining the economic status quo was equally vocal and powerful although thousands of slaves escaped north through a network of secret routes known as the underground railroad slaves still comprised a third of the population in the slave states at the time of the 1860 census most northerners were unwilling to challenge the existence of slavery in the south yet many opposed its expansion into the western territories southerners felt just as strongly that the territories themselves had the right to decide their status a young politician from illinois abraham lincoln felt that the issue was a national not local one a house divided against itself cannot stand he said i believe this government cannot endure permanently halfslave and halffree i do not expect the union to be dissolved but i do expect it will cease to be divided in 1860 the republican party nominated lincoln as its candidate for president on an antislavery platform in a fourman race he won only 39 percent of the popular vote but a clear majority of votes in the electoral college the electoral college is the group of citizens who directly elect the us president following the popular vote 33the storm that had been gathering for decades was about to explode with brutal force southern states had threatened to leave the union if lincoln were elected the secessions started even before he was sworn in it would be up to the new president to try to hold the union together civil war and postwar reconstruction north and south went to war in april 1861 the southern states had claimed the right to secede and had formed their own confederacy their forces fi red the fi rst shots the northern states under the leadership of president lincoln were determined to stop the rebellion and preserve the union the north had more than twice as many states and twice as many people it had abundant facilities for producing war supplies as well as a superior railway network the south had more experienced military leaders and had the advantage of fi ghting mostly on its own territory for four years ground battles involving tens of thousands of soldiers and horses were fought in virginia maryland pennsylvania tennessee and georgia naval battles were fought off the atlantic coast and on the mississippi river in that area union forces won an almost uninterrupted series of victories in virginia by contrast they met defeat after defeat in slave family picking cotton near savannah georgia in the early 1860spresident abraham lincoln center at a union army encampment in october 1862 following the battle of antietam confederate dead along a stone wall during the chancellorsville campaign may 1863 victorious at chancellorsville southern forces advanced north into pennsylvania but were defeated at the threeday battle of gettysburg the turning point of the civil war and the largest battle ever fought in north america more americans died in the civil war 186165 than in any other confl ict in us history 34 35their attempts to capture richmond the confederate capital the single bloodiest day of the war was on september 17 1862 when the two armies met at antietam creek near sharpsburg maryland confederate troops led by general robert e lee failed to force back the union troops led by general george mcclellan and lee escaped with his army intact mcclellan was fi red although the battle was inconclusive in military terms its consequences were enormous britain and france had been planning to recognize the confederacy they delayed their decisions and the south never received the aid it desperately needed several months later president lincoln issued a preliminary emancipation proclamation it freed all slaves living in confederate states and authorized the recruitment of african americans into the union army now the north was no longer fi ghting just to preserve the union it was fi ghting to end slavery union forces gained momentum in 1863 with victories at vicksburg in mississippi an d gettysburg in pennsylvania and then with the scorchedearth policy of general william t sherman as he marched across georgia and into south carolina in 1864 by april 1865 huge union armies under the command of general ulysses s grant had surrounded robert e lee in virginia lee surrendered and the american civil war was over the terms of surrender were ge nerous the rebels are our countrymen again grant reminded his troops in washington president lincoln was ready to begin the process of 36reconciliation he never got the chance less than a week after the south surrendered he was assassinated by a southerner embittered by the defeat the task would fall to lincolns vice president andrew johnson a southerner who favored quick and easy reconstruction johnson issued pardons that restored the political rights of many southerners by the end of 1865 almost all former confederate states had held conventions to repeal the acts of secession and to abolish slavery but all except tennessee refused to ratify a constitutional amendment giving full citizenship to african americans as a result republicans in congress decided to implement their own version of reconstruction they enacted punitive measures against former rebels and prevented former confederate leaders from holding offi ce they divided the south into fi ve military districts administered by union generals they denied voting rights to anyone who refused to take a loyalty oath to the union and they strongly supported the rights of african americans president johnson tried to block many of these policies and was impeached the vote fell short and he remained in offi ce but congress would continue to wield enormous power for the next 30 years the divisions and hatreds that had led to the civil war did not disappear after the fi ghting stopped as southern whites regained political power southern blacks suff ered they had gained their freedom but were prevented from enjoying it by 37local laws denying them access to many public facilities they had gained the right to vote but were intimidated at the polls the south had become segregat ed and would remain so for 100 years the postwar reconstruction process had begun with high ideals but collapsed into a sinkhole of corruption and racism its failure deferred the struggle for equality for african americans until the 20th century when it would become a national not just a southern issue growth and transformation the united states came of age in the decades following the civil war the frontier gradually vanished a rural republic became an urban nation great factories steel mills and transcontinental railroads were built cities grew quickly and millions of people arrived from other countries to begin new lives in a land of opportunity inventors harnessed the power of science alexander graham bell developed the telephone thomas edison produced the light bulb and with george eastman the moving picture before 1860 the government issued 36000 patents in the next 30 years it issued 440000 it was an era of corporate consolidation especially in the steel rail oil and telecommunications industries monopolies denied competition in the marketplace which led to calls for government regulation a law was passed in 1890 to prevent monopolies from restraining trade but it was not vigorously enforced at fi rst even with the great gains in industry farming remained americas basic occupation yet it too witnessed enormous changes farmland doubled and scientists developed improved seeds machines including mechanical planters reapers and threshers took over much of the work that had previously been done by hand american farmers produced enough grain cotton beef pork and wool to supply the growing domestic market and still have large surpluses to export the western region of the united states continued to attract settlers miners staked claims in the orerich mountains

about 30 years from the time that europeans landed on the east coast of america their migration westwa rd meant confrontation with native peoples for many years government policy had been to move native americans beyond the reach of the white frontier to lands reserved for their use time and again however the government ignored its agreements and opened these areas to white settlement in the late 1800s sioux tribes in the northern plains and apaches in the southwest fought back hard to immigrants arriving at ellis island in new york city principal gateway to the united states in the late

government forces offi cial policy after these confl icts was wellintentioned but sometimes proved disastrous in 1934 congress passed a measure that attempted to protect tribal customs and communal life on the reservations the last decades of the 19th century saw a race by european powers to colonize africa and compete for trade in asia many americans believed the united states had a right and duty to expand its infl uence in other parts of the world many others however rejected any actions that hinted at imperialism a brief war with spain in 1898 left the united states with control over several spanish overseas possessions cuba puerto rico guam and the philippines offi cially the united states encouraged them to move toward selfgovernment but in fact it maintained administrative control idealism in foreign policy existed alongside the practical desire to protect the economic interests of a onceisolated nation that had become a world power discontent and reform by 1900 americas political foundations had endured growing pains civil war prosperity and economic depression the ideal of religious freedom had been sustained free public education had largely been realized and a free press had been maintained at the same time however 43political power seemed concentrated in the hands of corrupt offi cials and their friends in business in response a reform movement called progressivism arose its goals included greater democracy and social justice honest government and more eff ective regulation of business writers and social critics protested practices that were unfair unhealthy and dangerous upton sinclair ida m tarbell theodore dreiser lincoln steff ens and others produced a literature of exposure that put pressure on lawmakers to correct these abuses through legi slation the reformers believed that expanding the scope of government would ensure the progress of us society and the welfare of its citizens president theodore roosevelt embodied the spirit of progressivism and believed that reforms needed to be addressed nationally he worked with congress to regulate monopolies and take legal action against companies that violated the law he also was tireless in his eff orts to conserve the united states natural resources manage public lands and protect areas for recreational use reforms continued during the presidencies of william howard taft and woodrow wilson the federal reserve banking system was established to set interest rates and control the money supply the federal trade commission was established to deal with unfair methods of competition by businesses new laws were enacted to help improve working conditions 44for sailors and railroad laborers a county extension system was developed to help farmers get information and credit and taxes on imported goods were lowered or eliminated to help reduce the cost of living for all americans the progressive era was also the era when great numbers of people from all over the world came to the united states almost 19 million people arrived between 1890 and 1921 earlier immigrants had been chiefl y northern and western europeans and some chinese the new arriv als came from italy russia poland greece the balkans canada mexico and japan the united states has always been a melting pot of nationalities and for 300 years few restrictions were placed children working at the indiana glass works in 1908 enacting child labor laws was one of the principal goals of the progressive movement in this era 45on immigration starting in th e 1920s however quotas were established in response to americans fears that their jobs and culture were being threatened by the newcomers while large surges of immigration have historically created social strains most americans whose own ancestors arrived as immigrants believe that the statue of liberty in new york harbor represents the spirit of a welcoming land to those yearning to breathe free this belief has preserved the united states as a nation of nations world war i 1920s prosperity the great depression war in europe in 1914 with germany and austria hungary fi ghting britain france italy and russia aff ected us interests almost from the start the british and the german navies both interfered with american shipping but german submarine attacks were deadly almost 130 americans died when a submarine sank the british ocean liner lusitania in 1915 president woodrow wilson demanded an end to the attacks and they stopped for a while but by 1917 they had resumed the united states declared war the eff orts of more than 1750000 us troops played a decisive role in the defeat of the german and austrohungarian alliance an armistice technically a truce but actually a surrender was concluded on november 11 1918 president wilson negotiated an end to the confl ict based on his 14point plan for achieving la sting peace it included an end to secret international agreements free trade between nations a reduction in national armame nts selfrule for subjugated european nationalities and fo rmation of an association a league of nations to help guarantee political independence and territorial integrity for large and small countries alike the fi nal peace treaty however contained virtually none of these points as the victors insisted on harsh punishment wilsons idea of a league of nations remained in the treaty of versailles but even he was unable to gain enough support for the concept and the united states rejected it america reverted to its instinctive isolationism american infantry forces in 1918 fi ring a

struggling because of the abrupt end of wartime demand bolshevik violence fueled a red scare that led to decades of militant hostility toward the revolutionary communist movement despite these problems for a few years in the 1920s the united states enjoyed a period of real and broadly distributed prosperity families purchased their fi rst automobile radio and refriger ator and they began going to the movies regularly and suff ragists after decades of political activism succeeded in getting approval of a constitutional amendment in 1920 that gave women the right to vote the good times did not last the value of many stocks which had become artifi cially infl ated fell dramatically in october 1929 over the next three years the business recession in america became part of a worldwide economic depression businesses and factories shut down banks failed farm income dropped by november 1932 20 percent of americans were unemployed the presidential campaign that year was chiefl y a debate over the causes of the great depression and ways to reverse it incumbent herbert hoover had started the process of rebuilding the economy but his eff orts had little impact and he lost the election to franklin roosevelt roosevelt was infectiously optimistic and was re ady to use federal authority to achieve bold remedies under his leadership the united states would enter another era of ec onomic and political change 48the new deal and world war ii in the early 1930s president franklin roosevelt proposed a new deal a plan designed to lift americans out of the great depression as quickly as possible he noted that democracy had disappeared in other countries at that time not because the people opposed democracy but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity under his leadership a federal corporation was established to insure deposits in savings banks regulations were imposed on the sale of stocks laws were passed to guarantee the right of workers to be represented by unions farmers received subsidies for certain crops and assistance in preventing soil erosion the civilian conservation corps employed young men left depressionera soup line 1930s right president franklin d roosevelt signs perhaps the most farreaching legislation of the new deal the social security act of 1935 today social security one of the largest government programs in the united states provides retirement and disability income to millions of americans 49to plant trees clean up waterways and improve facilities in national parks the public works administration hired skilled laborers for largescale projec ts such as building dams and bridges the tennessee valley authority provided fl ood control and electric power for that impo verished area and the federal emergency relief administration distributed aid often in the form of direct payments a second round of programs employed workers to build roads airports and schools hired artists actors musicians and writers and gave parttime employment to young people it also established the social security system to help the poor disabled and elderly americans were generally unea sy with the idea of big government yet they wanted the government to take greater responsibility for the welfare of ordinary people and while the new deal provided tangible help for millions of americans it never succeeded in restoring prosperity better times would come but not until after another world war had swept the united states into its path the united states tried to remain neutral while totalitarian regimes in germany italy and japan expanded their control over neighboring countries debate intensifi ed after germany invaded france and began bombing britain despite strong isolationist sentiment congress voted to conscript soldiers and strengthen the military 50 world war ii in the pacifi c was characterized by largescale naval and air battles here a japanese plane plunges down in fl ames during an attack on a us

lightning fi ghter planes during world war ii with its massive output of war materiel the united states became in the words of president roosevelt the arsenal of democracy 52most people were focused on what was happening in europe when japan threatened to seize sources of raw materials used by western industries in response the united states imposed an embargo on the one commodity japan needed above all others oil and demanded that it withdraw from territories it had conquered japan refused and on december 7 1941 it carried out a devastating attack on the us pacifi c fleet at pearl harbor hawaii the united states declared war on japan germany and italy by then allies of japan declared war on the united states american industry and agricu lture were harnessed for the war eff ort production of military equipment was staggering 300000 aircraft 5000 cargo sh ips 60000 landing craft and 86000 tanks in less than four ye ars much of the work was done by women who went to work in factories while men went to fi ght the united states britain and the soviet union allied to counter the nazi threat decided that their primary military eff ort was to be concentrated in europe they were determined to break the germanitalian grip on the mediterranean and prevent the fall of moscow then they would liberate rome and paris and fi nally berlin from germanys occupation of poland in 1939 to its surrender in 1945 the war in europe claimed the lives of millions of people soldiers and civilians alike millions more were exterminated 53in the holocaust nazi germanys systematic policy of genocide against the jews and other groups the war in asia was largely a series of naval battles and amphibious assaults to break the japanese grip on islands in the pacifi c ocean fighting there continued after the fi ghting in europe had stopped the fi nal battles were among the wars bloodiest most americans including president harry truman believed that an invasion of jap an would be even worse truman was willing to use the newly developed atomic bomb to bring the war to an end when japan refused to surrender he ordered bombs dropped on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki the plan worked japan surrendered and world war ii was fi nally over in august 1945 only later would people realize the full implications of the awesome destructive power of nuclear weapons the cold war korean con ict and vietnam the united states played a major role in global aff airs in the years immediately after world war ii especially through its infl uence in the newly formed united nations and north atlantic treaty organization nato the most important political and diplomatic issue of the early postwar period was the cold war it grew out of longstanding disagreements between the united states and the soviet union over which type of government and economic system produced the most liberty equality and prosperity faced with a postwar world of civil wars and disintegrating empires the united states hoped to provide the stability to make peaceful reconstruction possible it advocated democracy and open trade and committed 17000 million under the marshall president harry s truman holds a newspaper that wrongly announced his defeat by republican candidate thomas dewey in the 1948 election us infantry fi re against north korean forces invading south korea in 1951 in a confl ict that lasted three painful years 54 55plan to rebuild western europe the soviet union wanted to secure its borders at all costs it used military force to help bring communist regimes to power in central and eastern europe the united states vowed to contain soviet expansionism it demanded and obtained a full soviet withdrawal from iran it supported turkey against soviet attempts to control shipping lanes it provided economic and military aid to greece to fi ght a strong communist insurgency and it led the eff ort to airlift millions of tons of supplies to berlin when the soviet union blockaded that divided city with most american aid moving across the atlantic little could be done to prevent the communist forces of mao zedong from taking control of china in 1949 when north korea supported by china and the soviet union invaded south korea the next year the united states secured un support for military intervention the north koreans were eventually pushed back and a truce was signed but tensions would remain high and us troops would stay for decades in the mid1960s the united states sent troops to defend south vietnam against a communist insurgency based in north vietnam american involvement escalated greatly but was not enough to prevent the south from collapsing in 1975 the war cost hundreds of thousands of lives it also caused bitter divisions at home making americans wary of further foreign entanglements 56cultural change 19501980 most americans felt confi dent with their role in the world in the 1950s they accepted the need for a strong stance against global communism and supported eff orts to share the benefi ts of democracy as widely as possible at home they were experiencing phenomenal economic gains and a shift to a service economy a boom in births fueled the growth of suburban areas around cities yet not all americans participated in this good life and gradually challenges to the status quo began to mount african americans launched a movement to guarantee fair treatment everywhere they won a major victory in 1954 when the supreme court ruled that separate educational facilities for black children were not equal to those for white children the decision started the process of desegregating the nations public schools in the 1960s led by the reverend martin luther king jr and with the support of president lyndon johnson african americans won passage of civil rights and voting rights legislation some black leaders such as malcolm x argued against interracial cooperation and some militant calls for reform led to violence however many african americans made quiet steady progress into the ranks of the middle class leading to a profound demographic change in american society during the 1960s70s many american women expressed 57frustration that they did not have the same opportunities as men led by writer betty friedan and journalist gloria steinem they organized a movement that helped change laws and traditions to give women the chance to compet e equally with men in business and education however their eff orts to adopt a constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women fell short when only 35 of the necessary 38 states ratifi ed it a new generation of nativeamerican leaders organized to defend the rights the government had promised in various treaties with tribal groups they used the court system to regain control of tribal lands and water rights they used the legislative process to get the assistance they needed to house and educate their people the fi rst native american to be elected to the senate was ben nighthorse campbell in 1992 hispanic americans especially those whose families came from mexico central america puerto rico and cuba became more politically active too they were elected to local state and national offi ces and they organized to fi ght discrimination csar chvez for example led a nationwide consumer boycott of california grapes that forced growers to negotiate with his united farm workers union for higher wages and improved working conditions many students became politically active to protest the war in vietnam which they believed was immoral they organized large protests that eventually put pressure on president 58 jackie robinson sliding home in a 1948 baseball game robinson broke the color barrier against black professional baseball players when he joined the brooklyn dodgers and became one of the stars of the game americas fi rst star of rock and roll elvis presley performing on televisions ed sullivan show september 9 1956 martin luther king jr escorts children

the socalled counterculture were long hair rockandroll music and the use of illegal drugs americans concerned about the environment organized eff orts to reduce air and water pollution the year 1970 saw the fi rst earth day celebration and the creation of the environmental protection agency environmental legislation refl ected the need to reduce pollutants without imposing burdensome costs on industries the great social changes of the 1950s1980s grew out of an open fl uid and diverse society demands for change were sometimes peaceful so metimes deadly compromises president lyndon b johnson engineered the most ambitious domestic legislative agenda through congress since roosevelts new dealthe crest of the counterculture wave in the united states the threeday 1969 outdoor rock concert and gathering known as woodstock 60were necessary surely if sometimes slowly the united states changed to better refl ect its multicultural foundation end of the 20th century the united states has always experienced periods of political polarization as americans debated ways to deal with international events demographic change and the eff ects of technological innovation the last decades of the 20th century were no exception the liberal activism of the 1960s70s was eclipsed by a new conservatism in the 1980s conservatives advocated limited government a strong national defense a fi rm stance against communism tax cuts to spur economic growth tough anticrime measures more religious ex pression in public life and a stricter code for social behavior former actor and republican governor of california ronald reagan who represented stability to many americans won two terms as president his supporters credit his policies with hastening the collapse of the soviet union americans moved to a more centrist position in 1992 and elected as president arkansas governor bill clinton who had organized his campaign around the themes of youth and change some of clintons proposals were quite liberal such as his plan for a governmentmanaged health care system 61which congress never voted on another proposal ending government payments to welfare recipients and helping them get jobs was coopted from conservatives and eventually proved quite successful normal diff erences in politics turned especially bitter after the presidential election of 2000 the popular vote and the electoral college vote were nearly evenly divided between democrat al gore and republican george w bush thousands of ballots cast in the state of florida were contested after a series of court challenges over laws and procedures governing recounts the us supreme court handed down a narrow decision that eff ectively gave the election to bush bush expected to focus on domestic issues such as education the economy and social security but his presidency changed irrevocably on september 11 2001 on that day foreign terrorists hijacked four passenger airplanes and crashed them into the world trade center towers in new york city the defense departments pentagon headquarters near washington dc and a rural area of pennsylvania bush declared war on global terrorism americans were generally united in the early phases but many grew increasingly uncomfortable as the operation expanded the longterm eff ects of events and trends occurring at the beginning of the 21st century have yet to be fully understood 62 left fi refi ghters beneath the destroyed vertical struts of the world trade centers twin towers after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington dc above projected image of how the new york city skyline might look with the addition of freedom tower which will be built at the world trade center site 63 afterword from its origins as a group of obscure colonies hugging the coast of the atlantic ocean the united states has undergone a remarkable transformation one political analyst has called it the fi rst universal nation its population of 300 million people represents almost every nationality and ethnic group on earth it is a nation where the pace and extent of change economic technological cultural demographic and social is unceasing events in the united states are often the fi rst sign of the modernization and change that inevitably bring other nations and societies into an increasingly interdependent interconnected world yet the united states also maintains a sense of continuity it possesses core values that can be traced to its founding as a nation in the late 1700s these include a faith in individual freedom and democratic government and a commitment to economic opportunity and progress for all they are the legacy of a rich and turbulent history the continuing task of the united states is to ensure that its values of freedom democracy and opportunity are protected and will fl ourish through the 21st century 64 photo credits credits from left to right are separated by semicolons from top to bottom by dashescover
