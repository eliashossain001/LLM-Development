# 🚀 Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository is dedicated to the step-by-step development of a **Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch**. The primary focus is to implement and understand each core component of a Transformer-based architecture, including self-attention, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and more.
